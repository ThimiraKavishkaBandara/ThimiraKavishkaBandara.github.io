    <h2>Exploring Population of leading Polluters</h2>
    <p>"China, the United States, and India emerge as significant contributors to global pollution across multiple sectors,
        reflecting the magnitude of their industrial activities and population sizes. Drawing insights from Garret Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons,
        it becomes evident that population increase plays a pivotal role in exacerbating pollution levels. As these nations experience rapid population growth,
        the strain on finite resources intensifies, leading to overexploitation and degradation of the environment.
        The tragedy of the commons highlights how individual actors, in their pursuit of self-interest, tend to deplete shared resources,
        ultimately leading to collective harm. In the context of China, the United States, and India,
        the sheer size of their populations magnifies the pressure on energy production, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing,
        thereby intensifying pollution levels. Addressing this global challenge requires collaborative efforts, sustainable policies, and innovative technologies to mitigate the adverse impacts of human activities on the environment and preserve the planet for future generations.
        Furthermore, a comprehensive dashboard has been developed to provide a deeper look into the population habits of these three countries
        from 1970 to 2022. This interactive dashboard will allow users to explore the physical population growth within each country,
        gaining valuable insights into the dynamics of their population changes over time."</p>
